     "Double Buffering"
     
     `r`, `w` represent indices that define where data should be written to and read from.
     `n` is a flag representing the presence of new data to be read.

     There are two "channels" of data in `data`. In order to avoid a data-race, the real-time thread
     should not write to the memory that the UI thread is reading from.

     When the non-real-time thread needs new data, it performs an atomic XOR operation:
     `r = r ^ n`
     `w = w ^ n`
     
     If `n` has been set, the read/write indices will swap. Otherwise, they'll remain the same until
     the write stage has completed and new data is present to be written.

    /**
     Install a tap on the output bus of the Assemble core in order to access the sample data.

     Samples from the Assemble core are copied to a block of memory reserved for `points` samples.
     The samples are accumulated from the tap in buffer sizes of `bufferSize`, but only `points` values are produced. Each of these values is the arithmetic mean of some sub-sequence of `step` samples.

     For example, `points[k]` is the average of the samples in `floatBuffer[0][k ..< k + step]`.

     `vDSP_meanv` is from the `Accelerate` framework, which leverages the hardware's capacity for vectorisation in order to perform tasks like this efficiently.

     After copying the data into the appropriate channel in `data`, set `n`to `1`, which signals that new data is available for the UI thread to read from.

     - Note: This tap should be removed in `deinit`.
