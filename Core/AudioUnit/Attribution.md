The files in the `/AudioUnit/` folder, which define an `AudioUnit` subclass, were derived from the open-source framework [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit). These files were originally written by David O'Neill, Andrew Voelkel, Shane Dunne, and Aurelius Prochazka, and the original files can be found in the linked repository on GitHub.

The purpose of these files is to define a set of base classes for instantiating an AudioUnit that can be utilised from a Swift codebase.

At the top of each applicable file, the original author's name, AudioKit's copyright, and a link to AudioKit's MIT license have been written in a comment.
