    /// to terminate early when it's converted to a C string. In order to avoid this, each

    /// yield the correct value.
    /// \note This naturally limits the capacity of each attribute to 128 values.
    /// However, decoding attributes of this size is straight-forward, and moving to a
    /// larger character set would not break prior saves.
