The files in the `AU Interface` and `AU Base Classes` folders, which define an `AUAudioUnit` subclass, were largely derived from the open-source framework [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit). These files were originally written by David O'Neill, Andrew Voelkel, Shane Dunne, and Aurelius Prochazka, and the original files can be found in the linked repository on GitHub.

At the top of each applicable file, the original author's name, AudioKit's copyright, and a link to AudioKit's MIT license have been written in a comment.
